# reflections

This repo is recommended by a GitHub introduction course from Udacity.com.
As I worked through this online course, I answered the questions in .txt files and committed them here to this repo. This truly is my first introduction to GitHub. I hope I'll look back on this someday and see I've made some progress :D
