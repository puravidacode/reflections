This repo is recommended by the Automate the Boring Stuff with Python: Practical Programming for Total Beginners book by Al Sweigart.
As I am working through this book, I am answering the book's questions and posting here to GitHub. This truly is my first introduction
to GitHub. I believe all these files are simply text files. I hope I'll look back on this someday and see I've made some progress :D
