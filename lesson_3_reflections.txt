Q1: When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A1: allows you to access the repository, and all associated branches in that repo, from THE CLOUD! Hence collaborators can access it, I can access it from different computers, I don't need to lug around my hard drive with Git and the code on it. That's great!
